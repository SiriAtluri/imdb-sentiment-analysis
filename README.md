# imdb-sentiment-analysis
A machine learning project that makes sense of IMDb movie reviews. Using NLP, the model learns to understand emotions in text and predicts whether a review is positive or negative.

## Features of the Project
- Cleans the data – removes unwanted symbols, punctuation, and extra words.
- Understands text – changes reviews into numbers so that the computer can process them.
- Finds common words – shows which words are used most in positive and negative reviews.
- Checks review length – measures how long reviews are on average.
- Trains a model – teaches the computer to tell if a review is Positive or Negative.
- Tests accuracy – shows how well the model is predicting.
- Visualizes results – displays graphs and a confusion matrix (to compare correct vs wrong predictions).

👉 “The program also shows where the model makes correct predictions and where it makes mistakes. It tells us how many reviews were correctly predicted as positive or negative, and how many were wrongly predicted.”
